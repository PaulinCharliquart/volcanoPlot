Description: Interactive adverse event (AE) volcano plot for monitoring clinical trial safety. This tool allows users to view the overall distribution of AEs in a clinical trial using standard (e.g. MedDRA preferred term) or custom (e.g. Gender) catergories. This tool provides a stand-along shiny application and flexible shiny modules allowing this tool to be used as a part of more robust safety monitoring framework like the Shiny app from the 'safetyGraphics' R package.
